        <p>“Canyon Tutors was the reason I passed my college-level entrance exam. Reed’s patience and clear explanations made all the difference—I would not have been accepted into my dream school.”</p>

        <p>“My son was failing his math class, so many missing assignments and didn’t understand the concepts. I reached out to Canyon Tutors and quickly set up appointments to meet up. After the first session I knew right away this was going to work out great. Luke has a way with teaching math! He explained things so my son could understand and after the first week he told me that he actually did know what he was doing but just needed it explained in a different way. He quickly got my son caught up and passing. I can’t say it enough Canyon Tutors is amazing! Luke took the time to get to know my son and gave him confidence with his math.”</p>
